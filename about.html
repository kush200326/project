    <h2>How did Mobile Compare come about?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      In late 2020, a Commerce Commission review for the telecommunications
      market revealed that Kiwi consumers are significantly spending more than
      they have to on their mobile plans.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Commission urged mobile network providers to ensure that they provide
      more comparison information to consumers so that they can better
      understand how much they actually need to spend on their usage.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We want to see the telecommunications industry catch up to other
      sectors, like electricity, where consumers and comparison websites are
      making good use of the ability to compare usage and pricing, says Tristan
      Gilbertson, Telecommunications Commissioner.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The review work shows that consumers need to ask themselves how
      much money they could be saving. Most mobile plans can now be changed
      monthly so it just might
